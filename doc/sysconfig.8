.TP
\fBMAGIC_SYSRQ=<yes|no>\fR
Setting this to \fBno\fR used to disable the magic sysrq key and \fBStop\-A\fR (break on serial console) on \fBSPARC\fR\. This setting has been moved into \fBkernel\.sysrq\fR and \fBkernel\.stop\-a\fR settings respectively in \fBsysctl\.d/00\-system\.conf\fR\. Setting either of them there to \fB0\fR disables it, setting it to \fB1\fR enables it\.
.TP
\fBSTOP_A=<yes|no>\fR
Setting this to \fBno\fR used to disable the \fBStop\-A\fR (break on serial console) key on \fBSPARC\fR\. This setting has been moved into \fBkernel\.stop\-a\fR setting in \fBsysctl\.d/00\-system\.conf\fR\. Setting it there to \fB0\fR disables it, setting it to \fB1\fR enables it\. The setting should be present on \fBSPARC\fR only\.
.SS "/etc/sysconfig/keyboard"
.TP
\fBKEYTABLE=<keytable file>\fR

.TP
\fBNISDOMAIN=<nis domain name>\fR:

.TP
\fBNOZEROCONF=<value>\fR
Set this to not set a route for dynamic link\-local addresses\.
.TP
\fBNETWORKDELAY=<delay in seconds>\fR
Delay in seconds after all network interfaces are initialized\. Useful if network has spanning tree running and must wait for STP convergence\. Default: \fB0\fR (no delay)
.TP
\fBWAIT_UNTIL_REACHABLE=<IP address|DNS name>\fR
Network initscript will wait until specified target is reachable\. It starts to reaching passed IP address or DNS name every second until it reach it sucessfully or until it reach preset delay \fBNETWORKDELAY\fR (default \fB30\fR)\. It works with both IPv4 and IPv6 adress and also with DNS name\. Default: (not set)
.IP
Example: \fBWAIT_UNTIL_REACHABLE=8\.8\.8\.8\fR
.TP
\fBRES_OPTIONS=<list of resolv\.conf options>\fR
Option takes a space\-separated list of resolver options as explained in resolv\.conf(5)\.
